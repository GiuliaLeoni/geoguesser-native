# (app name pending) geoguesser-native 

## Concept

<p> This is the start of a geoguesser inspired native application, implementing multiplayer interaction to encourage people to get to know new places in their area or around the world through a gamified sense of community. </p>

<p> Users will be able to take a photo at a location which will be public for other users to view. Others may choose a photo to take a guess at where that photo was taken using the React Native map api. The user who guesses closest to the location wins. </p>
